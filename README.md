# elm-vectors

This [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) library provides polymorphic Vector types and some general operations for them.


```elm


type Vec2 a
    = Vec2 a a



```


If you're looking for something fast and `Float` specific, than maybe the [elm-community/linear-algebra](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/linear-algebra/latest) is a good choice for you.

A source of inspiration was Haskell's [linear package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear).
